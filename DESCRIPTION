Description: Takes Poisson or Binomial discrete spatial data and runs a Gibbs sampler for a variety of Spatiotemporal CAR models. Includes measures to prevent estimate over-smoothing through a restriction of model informativeness for select models. Also provides tools to load output and get median estimates.
